For Mac Users:
Go to https://www.python.org/ and download the latest python version. Make sure
to add python to your PATH variable.

After adding python to your PATH, you can either run the script from the command
line or use the python shell.

For the shell:
Double-click on the python.py file, and, if you have your PATH set correctly,
the file should open up.

For the command prompt:
Use the "python python-password-generator.py" to run the file. I would suggest
copying the file to a safe spot (your home directory, or another spot you
know where it is). You must be IN the directory in order to run it using this
command.
